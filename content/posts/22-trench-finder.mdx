During construction electrical cables are burried running from the substation to each piece of equipment.
This requires large amounts of earth works, to lower this cost an algorithm was developed to run the cables in efficient trenches.
A DBScan clustering algorithm was used to group nearby equipment with additional constraints giving a set number of trenches rather than complete earthworks.
This reduced engineering design time by a week for each project.
