## Project Overview

Led the platform switch to Databricks and implemented a real-time process anomaly detection system for a mineral processing plant.
This project combined MLOps practices with industrial process engineering to create a system that could identify processing anomalies in real-time, 
automatically trigger control adjustments, and continuously improve through operator feedback.

The most successful model implementation resulted in a **$3.6 million increase in weekly revenue** at a single plant.

## The Technical Challenge

Processing plants operate with extremely tight margins and complex operational parameters. 
Small deviations in processes can lead to significant inefficiencies and lost production. 
Traditional monitoring approaches were reactive, leading to suboptimal operations and delayed responses to emerging issues.

Our goal was to develop a system that could:
- Process high-resolution time series data (2-second intervals)
- Detect anomalies in critical equipment performance in real-time
- Integrate with existing SCADA systems and PLCs
- Enable continuous model improvement through operator feedback
- Reduce model deployment time from 1 month to 1 week

## Architecture and Technologies

We built a comprehensive data pipeline and model deployment infrastructure using:

{/* ![Architecture Diagram](/images/process-anomaly-architecture.png) */}

- **Data Ingestion**: Azure Event Hubs for real-time data collection
- **Stream Processing**: Azure Stream Analytics to process incoming telemetry
- **Data Storage**: Time Series Insights (TSI) for efficient time-series storage
- **Compute Platform**: Databricks for scalable data processing and model training
- **Development**: PySpark notebooks organized in Bronze, Silver, Gold architecture
- **Model Lifecycle**: MLFlow for experiment tracking and model versioning
- **Training Automation**: Azure Functions for triggering model retraining
- **Deployment**: Azure DevOps pipelines for CI/CD automation
- **Storage Optimization**: Delta Tables for efficient data versioning and retrieval

## MLOps Implementation

A key innovation in this project was the MLOps approach that reduced model deployment time from one month to just one week. We implemented:

1. **Bronze-Silver-Gold Data Architecture**:
   - Bronze: Queried TSI for training data ingested to delta tables with minimal transformation
   - Silver: PySpark used for cleaning and feature engineering (rolling averages & rate of change calculations)
   - Gold: Production-ready subsets of features to traine models

2. **Continuous Improvement Loop**:
   - Process engineers could tag anomalous data through a simple interface
   - Tagged periods were automatically added to training datasets
   - Manual review triggered automated retraining pipelines
   - Updated models were versioned in MLFlow and deployed through CI/CD

3. **Version Control Integration**:
   - All notebooks and configurations tracked through Git
   - Change tracking for all model versions and data transformations

## Case Study: Dense Medium Cyclone (DMC) Surging Detection

The most successful application was a machine learning model deployed for Dense Medium Cyclone (DMC) surging detection at a Queensland processing site. The system:

1. Continuously monitored cyclone performance data
2. Detected early signs of surging conditions before they became critical
3. Automatically adjusted plant feed rate and operating density parameters
4. Communicated with SCADA systems to implement control changes

In one instance, the model detected an emerging surging event and automatically reduced the plant feed rate while adjusting the operating density. This intervention:

- Alleviated the surging conditions before they impacted production
- Resulted in a 5% yield uplift in the primary product
- Maintained the overall plant yield
- Generated $3.6 million in additional weekly revenue through product quality improvements

## Beyond Anomaly Detection: Model Predictive Control

A POC was developed to push the output from the anomaly detection models into the site control systems.
With Control Engineering gaurd rails the model was able to automatically adjust control parameters in real-time based on the detected anomalies.
