## Business Case

Belt press filters add flocculant to product then squeeze it between two belts to separate solids from liquids.
To ensure correct moisture is achieved historically operators over floc to ensure the correct moisture is achieved.
Process Engineers estimate a wastage of $36,400 in flocculant per annum per filter, with 12 filters in the plant a saving of **$436,800 per annum**.
